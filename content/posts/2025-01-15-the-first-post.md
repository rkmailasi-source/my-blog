Every blog starts with a first post that tries to explain why it exists. I'll try to keep this short.

I write because it helps me understand what I think. Most ideas feel solid in your head and fall apart the moment you try to put them into sentences. Writing is the test.

I don't have a schedule or a niche or a strategy. Just things I find interesting and want to understand better. That's it.
